# Knowledge Roadmaps for Search and Rescue Missions

## Introduction
It is expected of robots to interact more richly with the world. Which is why us roboticists are no longer content with simply detecting and recognizing objects in images. Instead, what is desired is higher-level understanding and reasoning about complete dynamic 3D scenes. 
In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world _â€˜mean'_ to a robot, this is strongly tied to the question of _how to represent that meaning._ This twofold challenge of semantic mapping lies at the intersection of computer vision, task & motion planning, and simultaneous localization & mapping. 
My goal is to advance the design principles of semantic mapping to generalize its integration across task domains.

## Quick start
- pip install `networkx`
- select a demo at the bottom of `thesis_demos.py` and run it.


## Implementation
During exploration, this implementation should ground the knowledge about mission critical entities spatially in a sparse data structure which can be directly used for robot navigation.
This will enable spatial reasoning and provide a high level overview of the mission progress.

## Assumptions/Simplifications
- Currently the exploration algorithms is **frontier based lowest cost-to-go (shortest path)**
- currently the sampling of frontiers is simplified to sampling from a partially observable world graph. This should be expanded to sampling from the local-grid of the robot.
- The presented high level layer relies on robust local planners and controllers to deal with uncertainties at runtime.

### Conventions
Always pass the node indices/labels to one another and not the data objects. 
Data objects can be retrieved with get methods.

### TODO

#### general
- [ ] Emulate spot robot API one-on-one, run a test on the physical robot.
- [ ] Incorporate semantic information in exploration 
- [ ] Use the height of the local grid to calculate a risk for each frontier edge and sample multiple frontiers in the same region.
- [ ] Interface world-objects classes with the knowledge base. If the world object class is correlated with the search target class, then it should influence the value of that search direction.
- [X] Code a generator for large exploration graphs as a baseline and for testing

#### usecases
- [X] Basic Frontier Based Exploration
- [ ] Semantic Information Gain Exploration
- [ ] Victim Assessment Action Mapping
